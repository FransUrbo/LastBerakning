I would like to thank the following people that made this
possible:

Samuel Pickard (rival on the MoSync forum) for helping me
find out that there was a bug in MoSync.

Samuel Pickard (rival on the MoSync forum) for the RadioButton
example code that was crucial for this to work

Oscar Lindberg (offe on the MoSync forum) for the ScreenTransition
example code that made LastBerakning so much prettier :)

To the 'unknown coders' that made the 'General Tutorials'
that I used to start my project. Without that/those/them,
I would most likley never have started the MobileApp in
the first place - to lazy! :)

Francisco Lourenco, friend from when I worked at Portugal Telecom
a few years ago which helped me a lot with the C++ design. I'm not
a C++ coder. I know a little about object orientated programming,
but not nearly enough it seemed!

My class mates that keept bugging me about writing this program.
They needed it to! The math isn't rocket sience, but it's complicated
enough to make it cumbersome. Especially in the field!
